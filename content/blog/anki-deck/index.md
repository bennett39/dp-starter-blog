When I shared my [binary tree scratchpad](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/binary-tree/), several of you expressed interest in seeing my Anki deck.

So, here's the exported version of the [algorithms Anki deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P6SLVdf3TSC7xF6wxoymrIFPSIxkArci/view?usp=drive_link).

I don't think this deck is perfect or comprehensive. But it does include several different types of problems & some sample solutions in Python.
