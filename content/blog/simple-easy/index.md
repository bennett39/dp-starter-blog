Writing the simplest code to meet the requirements is deceptively hard.

You’ll have to cleanly model the problem at hand and make each part of the solution easy to understand. Elegant code appears obvious, but it takes tons of thought.

Instead of future-proofing your code - trying to imagine every possible future need, the best thing you can do is write extensible code that'll be easy to add to in the future.

This means simple functions, well-defined classes, and comprehensive tests. In the future, when you need a new feature, it should be clear where & how to add it.

Simple is the answer.

You can’t predict the future, so stop trying. Instead, do the best job meeting today’s requirements as simply as possible.
