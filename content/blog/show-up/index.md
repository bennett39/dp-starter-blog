Want to get better as a developer? A writer? A weightlifter? A creative? An entrepreneur?

It doesn’t take luck. Or a lot of work.

The biggest predictor of success is showing up, every single day.

When you let a project fizzle or are inconsistent, then it’s not likely to produce the results you want. Massive effort, that you allow to sputter out, won’t get you very far.

Showing up a little bit, every single day, will.
