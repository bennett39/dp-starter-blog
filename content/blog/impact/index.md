There are many ways to measure your software development career:

- Years of experience
- Places you've worked
- Technologies you've learned

But more than anything, I'd say a successful career comes from impact.

- Did people enjoy working with you?
- Did your contributions make a difference?
- Were you trusted?

I see a lot of engineers optimizing for resume or tech skills, when they should be aiming for impact.
