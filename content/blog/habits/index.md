*Most people overestimate what they can do in a day. They also underestimate what they can do in a year.*

Habits build consistency. Over time, they produce dramatic, compounding results.

The best time to start practicing great habits is 10 years ago. The second-best time is today.

Habits are so important as a developer, I wrote a whole book about it: [*The Habits of Top Developers*](https://bennettgarner.ck.page/products/habits-of-top-developers?promo=87BDFDD5HG)

It was a long road to create the book:

- In April: I surveyed my audience of over 10,000 software developers for their thoughts on some new book ideas I was exploring. 40% of you wanted a book about "the habits of top developers."
- Mid-May: I had the first draft of the book done with a rough table of contents. Dozens of you signed up to review the book (thank you!), and I chose a group of 10 early readers to provide feedback.
- Late-May: A week later, my early readers had returned their feedback & it was highly critical! There were great parts to the book, but there was still a ton of work to do to make it more digestible & useful.
- June: I wrote new content, restructured entire chapters, edited, added hands-on exercises, and formatted the book.

The result is a book with 106 pages of mindsets, principles, routines, and practical skills that will (gradually) alter the trajectory of your software career.

*I kindly ask that if you have the means to pay full price, please don't use the purchasing power parity program as a way to get a steep discount. Ultimately, we're using the honor system here, folks. Please take advantage of the program if you need it, but don't abuse it if you don't!*
