Software developers work in all kinds of fields: dating apps, insurance software, video streaming platforms.

If you enjoy your job at a mainstream startup working on rich-people problems, then that’s okay. If you’re leveraging such a job to learn new skills, make money for your family, or get a foothold in the industry, there’s no shame from me.

But the world is facing some big problems right now. Problems where software might be able to help.

Working on these big problems might be a good career move. You may find that you’re more connected to the work when it’s an important problem. Meaning and purpose are important parts of your career. Too often, developers ignore that fact.

Alternatively, perhaps you contribute your skills to a nonprofit or open source project on the nights and weekends. Or maybe you donate a portion of your large developer salary to an organization you trust. There’s no prescribed path. Hopefully, this article just gets you thinking.

I don't have answers, but I do want to prompt you with a question: What would it look like to code for good? Is the work you're doing now a net-positive for humanity & the planet?
