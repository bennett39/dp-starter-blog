Keeping a to-do list of things in your mind actually takes up space. I like to think of this space as mental load.

This could apply at work - many projects, milestones, and resolutions you're tracking all at once. Or, even debugging a complex system with many moving parts can quickly saturate your mental load.

Mental load also might apply outside of work. Errands to run, people to call/text, events to attend, chores that need doing. These are all examples of tasks that can fill up your brain's executive power & make you feel harried trying to get them all done.

There are (broadly) two strategies to respond to mental load:

1. Do more. Make a list of everything you need to do & strive to get it all done. Or...
2. Do less. Accept the fact that you won't get to it all & choose what matters right now.

In a finite life, with finite time, the only real option is #2. The promise of productivity systems is that you can do it all. But as anyone who has used those systems can tell you, there's always more to do & your to-do list will never be fully done.

The bonus of doing less? You produce better results when you focus your attention & protect your mental load.
