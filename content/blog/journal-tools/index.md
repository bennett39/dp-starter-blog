I've received several emails asking, "What tools should I use to start journaling?"

My answer is that it doesn't matter. Trying to optimize your tools for a habit you don't yet have is a fool's errand.

Use the writing space that you're most comfortable with:

- A notebook
- A simple text file
- Your email inbox
- A Word/Google doc

The tool you already know and will reliably use is the best tool.

Later, you might find that using markdown or knowledge management tools like Notion/Obsidian make sense for you. But I don't recommend starting there.

To start, make your journal really simple. So simple that it's easy. Because if it's easy, you're more likely to do it.
