People think good writing uses big words & literary language. Long sentences with complex structures.

That might work for literature, but it's counterproductive when you're trying to convey an idea.

For most people, most of the time your best bet is to write less, not more. Make it simpler. Keep the sentences short & the paragraphs easy to digest.

When you're writing to communicate ideas, you should polish those ideas into simple pieces. Then, fit them together.

Long-winded, big-worded, or twisty-complex writing all introduce points where you're likely to lose the reader. Or, create a misunderstanding.

To write better, write less. Short, powerful prose.
