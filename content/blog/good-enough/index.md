Perfect does not exist.

There’s no such thing as the perfect code base. You’ll never fully solve a problem. Software is not “done.”

Instead, it’s “good enough.”

It gets the job done. It solves the problem we set out to solve in a reasonable way. People can use this code to do what they need.

Great engineers know that over-building is a trap. Over-optimizing is a waste.

It’s a critical lesson: good enough is good enough.
