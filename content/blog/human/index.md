Remote work has a lot of benefits, but one big downside is isolation. Slack messages & Zoom calls are no substitute for real human connection.

This past year, the loneliness of remote work was a serious challenge for me. Alone, sitting, inside - that was my daily routine. It really started to affect my mental health.

So, I've decided to not work alone any more. I've found a new job (more details on that to come) & my plan is to join a coworking space or get a shared office. Starting next week, I'll be trying out some different spaces in my area.

I'm optimistic about getting out of the house, seeing others, and having a separate space for work that's not in my apartment.

Here's the bigger point: your environment matters. You don't have to decide to join a coworking space. You might just make improvements to your office or make sure you schedule walks during the day. Be intentional about where you do your work.

Speaking of missing other humans... I've missed all my readers! Expect some experiments with format & content as I reimagine the posts you receive from me, but I'm happy to be back.
