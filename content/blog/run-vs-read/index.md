There's a dichotomy I've noticed among developers.

When a test is failing or something is going wrong, some developers prefer to read the code to try to figure out what's happening.

Other developers prefer to change something & run the code again to figure out how it works.

In my personal experience, I find that the "runners" are much more effective than the "readers."
