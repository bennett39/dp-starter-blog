I've written before about why developers should keep a journal or daily note about their work.

Here are some of the small, recurring benefits you get by writing down your progress each day:

- Remembering where you left off yesterday so you can get started quickly
- Having a record of how far you’ve come over a timespan
- Keeping a written memory of everything you worked on for your resume/portfolio/salary negotiation/etc
- Flagging things you didn’t understand for later review
- Saving links to solutions that solved a problem so you can look them up later if you have the same problem
- VENTING FRUSTRATION!

These are just a few ideas that come to mind. There are many other reasons to keep a journal!

If you keep a journal, how is it helpful?

If you don't keep a journal, why not?

Send me an email. I read every reply.
