Big talk is the norm in the tech industry.

Companies do this all the time. They talk, meet, discuss, plan, and scope a big feature for weeks. It's the next big thing! It's sure to take the business to the next level!

So much wasted energy. All of it is just guess work.

You can’t know for sure what consumers will want ahead of time. So, instead of planning a big change, ask what’s the smallest possible change that will help you learn more?

Easy to say, hard to do.
