I've wasted a lot of stress and emotional energy on things that don't matter.

Other people's opinions of me, commitments I hastily made, unrealistic expectations.

I know I'm not alone, especially among my developer colleagues.

There's a problem where you think something like, "If we want to get this project done on time, I'll have to work overtime." At that point, working overtime seems like a foregone conclusion. But it's worth asking, does it really matter that the project get done on time?

In most cases, the world won't end & the company won't shut down if you don't finish the project on time. Sure, it's good to meet deadlines & you shouldn't always be behind or give unrealistic timelines.

What's the most likely outcome of you missing the deadline? Nothing.

I'm not advocating that you give up, become flakey, or reject good ideas. This is just a suggestion that everything isn't as serious as it seems.

This type of problem presents itself all the time. There appears to be a requirement, but the better question to ask is, "Does it really matter?"
