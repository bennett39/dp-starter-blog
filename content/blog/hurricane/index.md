I'm from Asheville, NC & my family still lives there. Last week, the area [received over 20 inches of rain](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/10/02/western-nc-asheville-residents-test-of-patience-fortitude-helene/75480224007/) & my parents lost power, internet, and roads/bridges in their area.

It would be an understatement to say I'm distracted this week. I've been checking the news constantly, and every once in a while my parents travel to the top of a hill to get cell service & place a phone call.

On Monday morning, I shared my personal worries at work & my team has been very supporive. I actually felt nervous about sharing my family's situation. I didn't want to seem needy or attention seeking. But the reaction from my colleagues put those fears to rest. If you have a good team, it's worth sharing with them when you're having a tough time.

Thanks to all my readers who checked in during this brief period of radio silence. In addition to the flooding in my hometown, I had house guests last week & I'm getting ankle surgery this week. So, I've been occupied with other things.

I'll be back with more updates soon!
