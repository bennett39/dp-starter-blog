Last year, I opened a few slots in my first cohort of email coaching for developers. Due to some personal reasons, I had to close email coaching after that cohort.

But I'm excited to announce that [email coaching](https://www.developerpurpose.com/coaching/developer-coaching) is back!

I'll meet 1:1 with coaching clients, identify your goals, make a plan, & offer unlimited access to ask questions as you go. If you've ever wished for a coach, counsellor, or sounding board to help you get unstuck in your career, here's an opportunity.

This isn't a hard sell, & I'll be back with normal free content tomorrow. But if you're interested in getting personalized coaching, this is my a great option & we had great success with last year's cohort.
