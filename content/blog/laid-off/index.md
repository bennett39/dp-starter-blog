This morning I received an email about layoffs and an ominous meeting invite. The company eliminated my position.

Many of my readers don't live in the United States, so this story will seem bizarre. Here, you can be doing your job well one day & not have a job the next day. I'm not alone. So far this year, [107 companies have laid of 29k employees](https://layoffs.fyi/), and we're only in February.

Getting laid off is a strange & upsetting experience. The plans I have for the next few months are all in question, & I'm not sure what I'll do next.

But I'm not going to decide anything today. I'll take the day to relax, read, sleep, watch TV, and try to gain some distance.

In the coming days, you might notice some disruption to the daily email. I'll be, hopefully understandably, focused on other priorities.
