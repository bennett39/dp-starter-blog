A great team leader is not necessarily:

- The best coder
- The longest/hardest worker
- The most experienced

Instead, a great team lead...

- Listens more than they talk
- Asks many good questions
- Removes problems, rather than creating them
- Speaks & writes in a way that's clear, simple, & kind
- Teaches while still being teachable
- Delegates tasks & avoids knowledge silos
- Is not an autocrat, but isn't afraid to be the tie breaker
- Knows how to say "no," especially in stressful times
