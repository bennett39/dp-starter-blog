Have you ever wanted to have a million dollars? Or, be able to run a marathon? Or, get a big promotion at work?

These are all examples of lagging indicators. They're results. You see them _after_ you've done the work to get them.

Lagging indicators are usually oriented around an end result. You can't just make a lagging indicator happen.

Instead, you need something that you can pursue regularly (daily, monthly, etc) that may produce the desired results. That's where leading indicators come in.

You can measure a leading indicator at a much finer detail & monitor it frequently. Success in achieving the leading indicator regularly should lead to improvement in the lagging indicator.

For example:

- You want a million dollars? Measure whether you contributed $1,000 to your savings/investments each month.
- You want to be able to run a marathon? Measure the distance you run each day & gradually increase it.
- Want to get a big promotion at work? Measure the week-by-week impact you're having for your team & the company (literally write it down).

When you're thinking about what you'd like to achieve, you can't stop with the lagging indicator - the result. You also need to find a leading indicator that will get you there. Then, measure and try to influence that leading indicator.
