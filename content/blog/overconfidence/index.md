Yesterday, I wrote about a [young Leonardo Da Vinci](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/davinci/) & his letter to Duke Sforza promising military designs that weren't realistic.

I like that story about a spunky young Leonardo, but it could easily be misunderstood as advice to be overconfident. So, let me clarify - I don't think you should promise things you can't deliver.

There's a fine line to walk between:

- Having the courage to try something new, starting before you feed "ready" or fully prepared
- Being overconfident & actually limiting yourself because of your inability to see your own weaknesses

You can try new things while still staying humble & open to learning. That's the key.
