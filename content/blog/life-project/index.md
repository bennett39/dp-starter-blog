Recently, I was talking with some friends about "life projects." Organizing principles or guiding values for your life.

Generally, a life project is a long-term goal that points toward an ideal you'll never perfectly achieve. Being a good parent is a great life project. As is living healthily or building a meaningful career.

Your life project can change over time. Or, your current focus may be on a certain life project. For instance, I've recently been thinking a lot about building community. Yesterday's post about building your tribe was in part inspired by this "life projects" question.

Some things that come to mind when I think about my current life project of community:
- I joined a coworking space where I see & talk with the same people every day
- I started a men's group & we get together to chat & do things outdoors
- My choir is starting to rehearse again, so I'm back to that community
- I regularly attend a local meditation center & enjoy the spiritual community I find there

I'd encourage you to think about your life projects & which ones currently hold your focus. What's most important for you in your life?
