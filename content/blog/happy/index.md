It's tempting to think that the next big achievement will be the thing that makes you happy.

- When I get that job
- When I get that promotion
- When I make XXXX amount of money
- When I work for X company

...then I'll be happy, successful, and able to enjoy my life.

Of course, the reality is that the feeling of satisfaction from an achievement fades pretty quickly.

Reaching the next level of your journey can certainly make your life measurably better - with money, power, or security.

But it can't make you happy. If you're chasing accomplishments in order to make you happy, you'll be on that treadmill your entire life.

## So, what's the secret to happiness?

If you know an easy answer, please let me know! I'd love to have a simple solution to one of life's big questions.

Here are a few things in common from some of the world's great philosophers & spiritual leaders:

- You can't control everything that happens in life, but you can control your reactions/judgments about what happens
- Failure is normal, natural, & to be expected; failing to reach a goal isn't a failure as a person
- We'll all die some day, but we live our lives mostly ignoring that fact. How would our lives be different if we remembered death?
- Caring too much about what other people think of you is a sure way to be miserable
- Life is happening in the world around you, not inside your head. Look out, rather than spending all your time looking in.
- You are not your thoughts & you don't have to believe everything you think

(I went into some spiritual/philosophical territory on this one. Did you enjoy it? Should I just stick to writing about software engineering? [Send me a reply](mailto:bennett@developerpurpose.com) & let me know.)
