Feedback is more important than skill when it comes to coding.

All the time, I see developers want to get it perfect on the first try. But you'll never write perfect code on the first shot.

By contrast, the best developers I know are awesome at getting simple code running as fast as possible. From there, they make gradual adjustments. They know the code won't be perfect, so they write a quick first version and start tweaking it.

This is great news. You donâ€™t have to be a coding god. Just get good at rapid iteration.
