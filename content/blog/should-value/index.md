It's very hard to change what people value.

If you say, "my team/clients/boss/etc should value my contributions more," you're in for a very difficult journey of trying to change people's perceptions & opinions. It's not impossible, but it's quite difficult.

I can think of two easier paths that are more likely to be successful:

1. Figure out what your team/client/boss *does* value & start focusing on that (a.k.a. change what you're offering)
2. Find a different team/client/boss who values the thing you're providing (a.k.a. change your target audience)
