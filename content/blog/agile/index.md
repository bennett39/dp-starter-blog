The Agile Manifesto & its subsequent principles, techniques, and guidelines radically transformed how we make software. Have you ever read it?

In [today's video](https://youtu.be/5eqn6UUNjnI), I give my reaction to this document, written in 2001, and reflect on how it impacts our work:

- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
