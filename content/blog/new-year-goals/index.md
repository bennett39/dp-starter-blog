Happy New Year! I hope 2024 brings you many good things.

Today, you'll probably hear about resolutions or goals for the new year. It's common to think that setting good goals is what gets you where you want to be in life.

I disagree with the common wisdom. I don't create new year resolutions. In fact, I don't have many goals at all.

My opinion: You don't need better goals. You need better systems.

Instead of goals, think of the direction you want to go & find something you can do systematically to get you there. Then, practice & refine those systems daily.

This applies at work, but it also applies in life generally. Don't set big goals. Choose a direction & find a way to gradually go there, step-by-step, day-by-day.

Here's the thing... Your end destination will certainly change. So, embrace (& get better at) the process, rather than setting big goals of reaching some "final" destination.
