One of my favorite quotes comes from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/pragmatic/):

    > "Delivering good software today is often better than perfect software tomorrow."

That quote is a descendant of the similar and more famous quote from Voltaire:

    > "Perfect is the enemy of good."

Both quotes point to the same truth — if you’re doing something risky, hard, or interesting, at some point you’ll need to stop & let it go. Ship the feature!

Shipping product is hard and scary, but shipping is the only way you get to learn from real users.

So, ship early and ship often. Make refinements over time. Accept that your first shot won’t be perfect, and that's normal.
