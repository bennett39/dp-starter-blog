To do lists keep growing. It's hard to track progress. They get messy after a while. Sorting them for priority can be a challenge.

I skip the never-ending to-do list. I don't find it helpful.

Instead, I make a new punch list of just 3-4 items every day. My daily note is how I decide what I'll tackle. If it's not on the daily note, it wasn't important enough to do today.

Each morning, I know there are a few things that I want to push forward. Not "finish that giant feature." Instead, I make my list items bite-sized. Achievable in an hour or two.

3-4 items is therefore achieveable in a day. I can usually finish the daily list & that means I made progress on important things!

Every morning is a new exercise in prioritization - if I only get 3 things done today, what should they be?
