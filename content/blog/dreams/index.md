I don't remember my dreams most nights, but I think I would like to remember my dreams. So, I'm keeping a dream journal of any small details I can remember.

For me, it's strange to think that much of the world has entire experiences in the middle of the night. I forget about dreams most days & many times when I do remember a dream it slips away quite quickly.

People who dream often find that it impacts their waking lives. Your dreams act as a sort of mirror for what your brain is processing. I'm not sure I totally believe that dreams have straightforward meanings, or that they can be interpreted, but I do think they're fascinating.

I'd love to know your experience with dreams. Do you dream? How much do you remember your dreams? Do you find your dreams impact your daily life? How so?
