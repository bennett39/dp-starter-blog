Recently, I've discovered a new project that I'm following. It's called [Not Not Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekKW8qRo72A).

The whole premise is about making work meaningful. Waking up curious & excited about what you'll do today. Spending your working hours on something that makes a difference.

Since I was laid off at the beginning of the month, those are big questions that I continue to think about every day. They've been questions on my mind for a while. That's why I started Developer Purpose & co-created the Meaning in Code podcast with Lillie.

Anyway, consider checking out the first episode of [Not Not Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekKW8qRo72A) & following along if the story resonates with you.
