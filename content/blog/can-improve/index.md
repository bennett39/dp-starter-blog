There's something in common across many facets of life (software development included):
- You get smarter by reading, but most people don't read any books
- You get healthier by working out, but most people don't exercise
- You become a better developer by learning hard things, but most developers stay in the shallow end of the pool

You're capable of learning! You can improve. It won't be simple & you're bound to make mistakes, but consider this your invitation to the deep end.

Coding is more fun when you push yourself. For that matter, life is more fun generally when you stretch your boundaries.
