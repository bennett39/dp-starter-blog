Often, we're tempted to gather more information "just in case" it's useful in the future.

Of course, the vast majority of things we learn never prove to be useful. The alternative routes you could've taken, books you could have read, recipes you could have cooked.

We've all experienced a YouTube rabbit hole, or clicking around Wikipedia following increasingly arcane topics. Humans like to learn, plan, & know our options.

But there's a strong argument - in the age of the internet & instant access to information - for just in time learning instead. The best time to look something up is when you need it.

That's not to say that learning for learning's sake is bad. You didn't waste your time entirely when you looked up just-in-case information. But you might've worried about & overthought an issue that could've been resolved easily with just-in-time information instead.

To be clear: one type of information gathering isn't better than the other. But in each situation, it makes sense to think about whether you can wait to gather the information you need.
