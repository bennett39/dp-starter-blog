What was your real motivation to become a developer?

You probably thought you’d like to make a decent living & work on interesting problems.

Maybe you’ve always loved computers & wanted a job that worked with them.

But if you think about it…

There are a bunch of other jobs out there that work with computers, work on interesting problems, and make a good living.

You could do something else and check all those boxes.

So, what’s the real reason you became a software developer?

Think about it and leave me a reply. (I read every email.)
