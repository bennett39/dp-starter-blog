Today is the first day I'm publishing the daily post on my new blog.

If you received this via email, it means it's working & you'll be getting my posts without interruption. You don't need to do anything.

Switching to a new place to write my blog has been difficult. It's a lesson in momentum that applies to all of software.

If you have an existing system, it's very hard to remove all dependencies on that system. Especially if you've been using it for a while.

This blog is a perfect example. It was relatively easy for me to set up the blog. But my email list also auto-sends when I publish a new post on Medium. I needed to replicate that functionality on this blog.

At work, we have another great example where a legacy service continues to run even though we've removed nearly every dependency! There's still one thing that needs the legacy service that we can't turn off.

I'm glad to be mostly migrated to this new blog. But I won't be leaving Medium entirely. Some longer format posts might still find a home there.

The good news for subscribers is you'll get an email regardless where I publish & you can be none the wiser.

## One other thing

I've moved some of my older posts (2+ years) from Medium to my new blog. You can check them out at [daily.developerpurpose.com](https://daily.developerpurpose.com).
