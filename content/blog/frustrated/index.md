"Ugh, it's not working, & I can't figure out why!"

Multiple times this week, I felt this way. I feel this way many times per month.

To me - and to many software developers I know - the frustration of not being able to figure out a problem is a huge part of the job. It's one of the defining emotions of software development.

For some people, this constant frustration would prove demoralizing. I don't blame them for feeling this way! I often feel angry, dissappointed, or fed up with the code.

But a trait all software developers seem to embrace (& perhaps secretly, masochistically relish) is the challenge of facing a new problem you don't know how to solve & repeatedly failing.

You often have to suffer through many moments of frustration before you get the payoff of the "Aha! It's working!" moment.
