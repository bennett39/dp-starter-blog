When you fight, nobody wins. This is true at work, but it's also true in life generally.

Even if you defend your point & vanquish your opponent, the victory is hollow. You've "won," but at what expense to your relationship & trust?

The much better strategy is to win over hearts & minds slowly. Build a culture of dialogue, not disagreement. Cooperate, rather than compete.

Martial artists know that avoiding a fight is the path of a true master. Even if you win the fight, the damage isn't worth it. If someone wants to fight, talk down the tension, wave a white flag, & walk away.
