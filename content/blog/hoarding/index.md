Hoarding knowledge is an anti-pattern.

Great developers know that concentrated expertise is a ticking time bomb. When the subject matter expert leaves the company or takes vacation, the problems start to appear.

What's more, the team works better and goes faster when all the knowledge isn't in silos.

You donâ€™t become more valuable by hoarding knowledge. Share it as openly and quickly as possible!

Get really good at sharing knowledge, and you'll get noticed on your team. Not for how much you know, but for how good you are at sharing it with others.
