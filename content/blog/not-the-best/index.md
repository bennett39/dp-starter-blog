One particular flavor of imposter syndrome is surprisingly common, even among the most senior developers.

I call it "Not the best"-itis. Comparing yourself to your peers in an endless loop. It takes this form:

- "I'm not the best programmer"
- "I'm not the best writer of documentation"
- "I'm not the best at design/architecture"
- "I'm not the best public speaker"
- "I'm not the best at debugging"
- "I'm not the best at going deep on a really complex problem"
- "I'm not the best at coordinating many different initiatives"
- "I'm not the best mentor for more junior developers"

My response: Of course you're not the best at everything!

Some skills will be your strengths. Others will be a challenge. That's totally okay, and it doesn't make you an imposter. It makes you human.

The best developers I know have one thing in common, though. It's an important step for advancing in your career...

Figure out which things you're good at & double down in them. Become the go-to expert for those skills. For the skills where you're weak, don't give up but also don't hold yourself to a high standard of being the best.

Be good enough in your weaknesses. Organize your work around your strengths.
