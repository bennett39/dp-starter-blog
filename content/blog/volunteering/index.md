Volunteering is one of the best things I've done since getting laid off.

Every week, I work a shift or two at [Food for Free](https://foodforfree.org/), a local food pantry that provides veggie boxes and frozen meals to people experiencing food insecurity in my area. My shifts are often a highlight of my week - out of the house, working with people, doing something good for the community.

If you're stuck in a rut, one of the best things you can do is get out and start working with other people. Volunteering feels great & I can't recommend it enough.
