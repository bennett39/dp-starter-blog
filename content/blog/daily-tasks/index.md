Friend of the email list, Hiro, wrote in with a few follow up questions to my post about my [daily notes](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/daily-note/).

He ran through some scenarios & wondered how I'd capture them in the daily note. Thought I'd share my answers with everyone!

1. Your partner/housemate asks you to get a few grocery items by 5 PM today before her cooking.

Since it'll be done today, it's fair game to go in the daily note. I don't restrict my daily note to ONLY 3-4 items. I just start the day with 3-4 items that are most important to get done.

If it becomes clear that I have too many things in my daily note to accomplish today, then I have the difficult (but important) decision of what to eliminate. Rather than leaving things to fall through the cracks, I actively try to decide what I won't be able to do.

2. You came across a Python code block that you need to research and will likely take a couple of hours to process.

This gets into the question of just-in-case vs just-in-time research. As much as possible, I prefer the latter. With some exceptions for learning about broad topics, I typically do research when I need it to solve a given task.

Research things "just in case" and you'll end up wasting a lot of time. Researching "just in time" means you can add it to your daily note as one of the day's tasks.

3. You got an email that you must reply to (work-related, from your boss/client), but it will likely take half an hour to look up something online.

I don't typically put emails on my daily note. Instead, I just triage my inbox & reply in batches as part of normal day-to-day operations.

I'm a fan of inbox zero, so it's very easy to know when I've looked at everything & what I still need to respond to.

## Final note

The daily note isn't the perfect system for everyone! I'm not suggesting you _should_ use the daily note or even that it's a particularly good way to organize.

It's just the system that works for me.

Thanks, Hiro, for the questions!
