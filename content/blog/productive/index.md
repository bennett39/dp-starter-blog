Productivity as a software developer is not about doing as much as possible.

Raw quantity of output might get noticed, but it's unsustainable. Don't work yourself to the bone.

Instead:
- Focus on doing impactful things
- Learn to say "no" or "later" to requests that aren't high importance
- Develop a reputation as someone who "gets things done"
- Become the go-to person for some topic

Doing as much as possible is a recipe for burnout. If you want to get ahead in your career, focus your expertise & finish what you start.
