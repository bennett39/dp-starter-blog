Between July 1, 2022 and February 1, 2024 I wrote something new for software developers on my blog every single day. That's 580 days in a row.

Recently, you might've noticed I haven't been quite so consistent. Thank you to all the list members who have written to check on me, wondering where I've gone.

I'm doing okay! The truth is that I haven't been thinking about software as much. Instead, I'm volunteering, reading, taking walks, meeting friends for coffee, playing my guitar, & watching the bulbs come up in our garden.

This is - ostensibly - an email list about software development, and I haven't had much to say about that, since I haven't been doing it. To be honest, the break from writing has been kind of nice.

I love & value the community from my email list, so I don't want to go dark forever. But I am exploring & experimenting with a new relationship to writing. Thanks for being patient while I'm away.

(P.S. - One other reason I haven't been writing is I've taken a few interviews with some companies I'm curious about. Once those interviews wrap up, I'll share more.)
