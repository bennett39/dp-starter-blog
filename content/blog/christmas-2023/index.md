Merry Christmas to everyone! Whether or not you celebrate Christmas, I hope you're enjoying family, friends, rest, food, and/or fun today.

Holidays - like Christmas - are a good chance to check in with what's important in your life. What do you truly value? How can you bring more intentional presence to your life?
