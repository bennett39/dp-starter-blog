Iâ€™ve written a series of posts where we build an increasingly-complex tic-tac-toe game from scratch, one step at a time.

The genesis post where I explain my philosophy behind the series:

*   [Learning Python? Start small](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/learning-python-start-small-29d15881f780?gi=cc508ae4654f).

Here are all the posts in the tic-tac-toe series so far:
