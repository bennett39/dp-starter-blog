Yesterday, a friend said, "I'm much more interested in what people are creating than what they are consuming."

We spend so much time talking about the shows we've watched, music we've listened to, and articles we've read. Indeed, many "hobbies" are just forms of consumption - collecting records, reading anime, or going to see indie movies.

My friend highlighted an important distinction that we don't often talk about. What are you making? Do you have a creative output?

Coding could certainly be creative. So, too, is writing. Singing or playing an instrument is creative. As is gardening. Or dance, or drawing, or photography.

You gain more pleasure and meaning from your hobbies when they're creative rather than consumptive.
