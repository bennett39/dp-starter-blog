Sometimes the best you can do is start over from the beginning.

Due to an injury, I didn't go to the gym for a while. I lost some strength, but more critically I lost the habit. When I finally went back, I had to start over with lower weights & rebuilding the habit.

Now, I feel the same about what used to be my "daily" email list. I've lost the habit & some of my writing muscles. But that's not a reason to stop writing regularly.

Similarly, there are many things in life where the best you can do is restart. It's difficult to start from the beginning again, but what choice do you have?

As I think about writing again, I'm wondering what new content I can explore that'd be useful for my audience.

In that spirit, what have you been thinking about recently? What have I missed in your life since we last talked?
