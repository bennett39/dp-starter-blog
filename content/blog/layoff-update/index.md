I was [laid off](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/laid-off/) on February 1st. Since then, I've been really grateful to receive [many kind notes](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/support/) from readers of this email list.

For everyone who has checked in on me personally - thank you - and here's a quick update...

- My former company is paying me 4 weeks of severance, which is low by standards of the tech industry but the continuing income helps regardless. I'm also elligible for unemployment insurance & have some savings. Fortunately, I'm not scrambling for money & don't need to find a new job immediately.
- The weekend after I was laid off, I already had a trip to New York planned to see some of my friends. It was the perfect thing. A change of scenery plus spending the weekend with some close people who I've known for a long time. Their support was super helpful.
- The layoff was a shock when it happened, but not a complete surprise. The company was struggling & I was laid off during the third round of layoffs in the past year. One of the feelings after my layoff has been relief. The shoe finally dropped & now I don't have to worry about working for a struggling company anymore.
- I've had some great experiences this month. The choir I sing in has a performance coming up. I took a flight lesson and piloted a small airplane for the first time. Together with two close friends, we spent 3 hours at a spa doing sauna/steam room/cold plunge. I'm going to see the premiere of a new opera on Friday night.
- Unemployment & freedom over my time is often fun, sometimes boring, and occasionally panic-inducing. I spend a lot of my time thinking about what's next, where I want to take my career, and what's meaningful to me. Sitting, indoors, alone all day as a remote-work software developer hasn't been great for my mental or physical health, so something will need to be different about my next job.
- I have a few leads on potential next steps for me, but nothing I'm ready to share with the email list quite yet. They're all still early ideas & conversations.

The general update is that sometimes I feel sad or anxious, but most of the time I feel hopeful & able to enjoy my new-found free time.

Since I think it's important to be honest about my experience, I'll share a personal update occasionally. Hopefully, someone on this email list will find it helpful or relatable. If you do, I'd love to hear from you - just reply to this (or any) email I send.
