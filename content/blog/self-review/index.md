Ready to push up your changes and request review?

Hold on there! First, push your code and give yourself a review. Look carefully, file by file, at the diff.

You’ll be surprised how often you discover your own typos, unintended changes, missing comments, etc. Be your own toughest critic. Give your code a thorough review before asking others.

That initial review is so important. It helps you tighten your changes up before anyone else sees them.

Self-review decreases code review churn. When you catch the little stuff on your own, your reviewers don’t have to point it out, “request changes,” then you fix it, re-request review, and wait until your reviewer can get back to it.

Do this every time. Make it a habit. You'll become a better developer & your team will notice the quality.
