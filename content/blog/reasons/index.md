Last week, I asked you, "Why did you become a developer?"

Many of you responded & I read them all! Looking at the responses, there are a few trends. I’d say the most common aspects are:

- Always learning new things
- Flexibility to work when & where you want
- Joy/fulfillment at solving difficult problems

Some of you mentioned money as well, and that’s certainly one reason to work in software, but I’d say it’s not anywhere close to the primary reason for members of my email list.

So now the question:

> You said you wanted this career for the learning, flexibility, and joy it brings you. Does your current work bring you learning, flexibility, and joy?
