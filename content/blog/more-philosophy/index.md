Yesterday, I wrote a post about [chasing happiness via accomplishments](https://daily.developerpurpose.com/happy/) & why that's a bad strategy for building a meaningful life.

Then, I asked whether you thought the post was helpful...

> I thought today’s words of wisdom were great... [I]t definitely reminded me of other elements of life besides work.

--

> I love that you went into a more spiritual and philosophical space in this email because these are exactly the types of questions I've been grappling with. It's always nice to know I'm not alone and hear how other developers are managing their mental and emotional health.

--

> Software engineering jobs can easily become all-consuming when boundaries aren’t set and so it is good to be reminded that there is so much more to life than our performance at work and the money in the bank.

--

> Thank you for sharing; (virtually) tacking these quotes up on my computer desktop.

--

> Just wanted to say I loved your last post on finding happiness. I think, having these kinds of posts in addition to tech focused ones help, since they help get a broader perspective on life.

I received many more emails like this! Happily, I didn't receive a single email asking me to shut up and only talk about software development.

So, I think I'll keep writing about these topics. Not all the time! But sprinkled in among the other posts.

Thanks to everyone who sent an email. I'm so grateful that this daily email list is full of people open to thinking deeply about life's big questions.
