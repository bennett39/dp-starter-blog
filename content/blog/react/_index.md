### Getting the Big Picture

> React stumped me at first.

Online tutorials and even the official documentation sometimes do a poor job of explaining how React works and why it works that way.

If you’re learning React, you likely don’t fully understand how everything fits together. Without that understanding, you’re gonna hit roadblocks and it’s gonna take you longer than necessary to get up to speed.

React is the most popular frontend library in the world for a reason, but you’ll likely have a hard time at first learning to think in React’s terms. Especially if you’ve never worked with other frontend libraries/frameworks.

When I started learning React, it was confusing. Components, props, constructors, component state, and JSX all conspired to jumble my brain. It wasn’t until I took a step back to look at the big picture and do some research that I finally understood how everything fits together.

> In this post, I’ll save you that reading and research. I’ve put together all my notes from learning how React works and distilled it down to the barebones essentials to help you grok React.

React can be complex, and most tutorials make it too convoluted, too fast. If you’re learning React, however, you only need to know a few key concepts in order to unlock its power. I’ll share those concepts here.

### React Isn’t a Framework, so Don’t Call It One

React often gets lumped in with Angular and called a “frontend framework.”

It may seem like a small distinction, but that term — “framework” — comes with a lot of baggage. Frameworks imply an ecosystem of tools that rely on one another. When you build an Angular app, you have to do it Angular’s way.

> But React isn’t like that.

It doesn’t rely on a specific ecosystem to make it work. It’s much simpler. React is a “library,” not a framework.

The distinction has profound implications for how you can use React. It can work atop different kinds of backends, and you can deploy it alongside other tools in the same app.

If you already have an existing app, adding React to that app slowly over time is totally possible. Just build it a component at a time!

#### **Ah-ha moment:**

> When you build something with React, you’re not really building a “React application.”

Instead, you’re just building a piece of your web page in React, and React takes care of how that one piece of the page functions and renders.

### Components are Cool!

> Since React is a library, not a framework, we’re building pieces of web pages in React, not entire React applications.

Of course, if you want to combine multiple pieces into a complete application, that’s up to you. But you can also just place little bits of React inside your normal HTML page if you want.

These “pieces of a web page” are React’s “components.”

When you use React, you’re using JavaScript to create components that you can place in your web page.

That relationship usually takes the form of creating a component:

class Hello extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>;    
  }  
}

And then use that component almost as you would an html tag. We use JavaScript to tell the browser where to place our new component.

ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('root'));

The code above tells React to place the new component into our HTML file wherever there’s an element with an id of ‘root’.

(If you’re new to React, chances are you’re scratching your head about mixing HTML tags directly into JavaScript. Not to worry, it’s not really HTML but a special markup for React called JSX. More on that in the section “Your Problem with JSX is You Don’t Understand JSX”.)

#### **Ah-ha Moment:**

You could build a completely static site in React that’s not interactive at all. You’d just use JSX to create components and then place them in your website. React doesn’t have to be interactive, it just **_CAN_** be and is good at it.

To be clear, for static sites, React and JSX aren’t good choices as far as templating syntaxes go. You’d probably want to pick something else that’s less complicated and has less overhead.

> Still, at its most basic, React is a way to define a piece of a webpage using JavaScript and then place that component into the webpage.

Components are reusable as well, so if we’ve defined we can use it as many times as we want anywhere in our site.

### The Deal with the DOMs

Seems cool, right? Templating and reusable components are far from groundbreaking, but at a basic, intuitive level that’s what React is doing.

> But how does React use JavaScript to place components into a web page?

When you use JavaScript to do something — anything — on a web page, the JavaScript you’ve written needs a way to interact with the HTML and other documents that make up your web page.

JavaScript does this through an API known as the Document Object Model (DOM). If you’ve written JavaScript, chances are you’ve heard of the DOM and interacted with it.

![](/Users/bennettgarner/Repos/medium-export-4b46aa4e91f20dbf349cd1ed9133a2978c8dcbbd9f7d7b84cef20f84ed36ffda/posts/md_1643327843943/img/1__aE2z8HxZ8lr8cIbz4waKog.png)

However, for complicated websites, managing and making changes to the DOM can quickly become a challenge. When multiple scripts need access to multiple DOM objects, maintaining a consistent state of the DOM requires all kinds of manipulations and checks, and some things you might want to do are downright impossible.

> Managing the DOM is where React is a breakthrough technology.

Instead of trying to manage the DOM directly, React creates a new version of it known as the React virtual DOM. When you write React code, you’re making changes to the virtual DOM, not the real DOM.

That’s why, in the Hello example I gave, we rendered to the ReactDOM, not to the actual DOM directly:

ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('root'));

When a user clicks a button or enters a value in a React component, React compares the state of the virtual DOM to the real DOM. If they’re the same, React doesn’t need to do anything. If they’re different, React updates the real DOM to match the virtual one.

#### Ah-ha Moment:

> React “reacts” to changes in the virtual DOM and makes those changes in the real DOM.

Mind blown???

So what have we learned so far?

*   React is a library that allows you to create reusable components.
*   It’s also a DOM manager that compares the virtual and real versions of your site’s document object tree.

The implication of this combination is you can write complicated interactions within and among components that render seamlessly without having to reload the page.

In addition, you no longer have to worry about the DOM and making changes to it. Instead, React takes care at compile time to warn you of any issues.

### Please Pass the Props

![](/Users/bennettgarner/Repos/medium-export-4b46aa4e91f20dbf349cd1ed9133a2978c8dcbbd9f7d7b84cef20f84ed36ffda/posts/md_1643327843943/img/1__djk0MzJw0BiDnZupDCX1hw.jpeg)

Okay, so we’ve got the core concepts of React: creating components and rendering them in a virtual DOM. Understanding those basic concepts is key to getting why and how React works when things get more complicated.

> In React, components can call and talk to each other. When they do, they can pass information between themselves as properties.

Imagine we’re creating a Sudoku, Checkers, or Chess game in React. The basic construct of the board would be:

class Board extends React.Component {  
    
  ...

  renderSquare(squareValue) {  
    return (  
      <Square   
        value={squareValue}  
      />  
    );  
  }  
    
  ...  
}

I’ve left out much of the details of the Board component, above, for the sake of highlighting how one component can call another.

In Board’s `renderSquare()` method, it returns a `<Square />`. This is a common pattern in React apps.

Likely, elsewhere in the Board class, the Board will call `renderSquare()` multiple times, creating many different Square components that are all children of the Board.

With each call of `renderSquare()` the variable `squareValue` can change. So, each new Square might have a different value.

These values that get passed from parent to child are what’s known as “props” in React (short for properties).

Within the declaration of the Square class, we can now access whatever information the Board passes in as a prop.

class Square extends React.Component {  
  render () {  
    return (  
      <button>{props.value}</button>  
    );  
  }  
}

Using `props.value` React knows to use the `value` that we passed in when we created the Square.

(This example comes from the React official tutorial where you build a Tic Tac Toe game. The Board component renders and manages 9 Squares as child components. See this [working example on Codepen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010).)

#### Ah-ha Moment

> React makes it really simple to pass information between components. But one thing to realize early on is that props only work in one direction.

Parents can pass info to their children, but if a child needs to pass info back to its parent, you’ll need to define a function in your parent that allows the child to move information back up the chain.

Passing props the wrong direction or trying to pass props up to a parent is one of the big mistakes new learners of React make.

### Move Power Up the Chain

Let’s imagine we want to do something when a button is clicked.

In vanilla JavaScript, we’d use an onclick event to update the DOM.

<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

React also uses onClick, but now we can use it to call other methods from our components.

class Button extends React.Component {  
  handleClick() {  
    // do something  
  }  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>  
        {buttonValue}  
      </button>  
    )  
  }  
}

If we want to pass information back to a parent component, we can define the `handleClick()` method in the parent component and then pass that method as a prop to the the child.

Now the Button component gets simplified to:

class Button extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <button onClick={props.onClick}>  
        {buttonValue}  
      </button>  
    );  
  }  
}

And the parent of Button now passes in the `onClick` method as a prop:

class ButtonList extends React.Component {  
  handleClick() {  
    // do something  
  }  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <Button onClick={() => this.handleClick()} />  
    );  
  }  
}

The astute reader will notice that we just took ~20 lines of React to do something that could have been done in one or two lines of JavaScript if we just managed the button directly.

> And you’d be right! If all you need is a single function for a single button in your application, don’t use React!

The structure above becomes valuable only when we need to render multiple Buttons, each with their own unique identifiers, but all of whom need a shared `handleClick` method.

Imagine a `ButtonList` component that manages multiple buttons:

class ButtonList extends React.Component {  
  renderButton() {  
    return (  
      <Button onClick={() => this.handleClick()} />  
    );  
  }  
  renderButtonList() {  
    let buttonList = \[\];  
    for (let i=0; i<10; i++) {  
      buttonList.push(this.renderButton());  
    }  
    return buttonList;  
  }  
  handleClick() {  
    // do something  
  }  
  render() {  
    return <div>{this.renderButtonList()}</div>;  
  }  
}

By moving `handleClick` up a level to the parent component, we do at least two things:

1.  We don’t repeat ourselves (DRY) when we create a new Button. The `handleClick` method is standardized across all buttons that are children of `ButtonList`.
2.  We gain the ability to see a complete list of the current state of all `Buttons`, because they will pass back information every time they get clicked. Instead of needing to view the state of each Button independently, we can now track the state of all Buttons and even revert changes (see "const vs let, below" for more details).

Of course, readers experienced in writing React code will note that my example above is not correct. We’re still missing a _key_ part of managing multiple child components ;).

Experienced React users will also point out that I could seriously clean up both these code examples with shorter syntax. These examples don’t NEED to be this long.

I’m keeping it verbose for educational purposes, but not to worry! I will shorten some stuff! (See Function Components, below).

### Don’t Forget the “Keys”

We’ve seen that React makes it easy to create multiple child components, pass information to those children via props, and even track the state of those children from the parent component.

![](/Users/bennettgarner/Repos/medium-export-4b46aa4e91f20dbf349cd1ed9133a2978c8dcbbd9f7d7b84cef20f84ed36ffda/posts/md_1643327843943/img/1__ebjc6tZABbzz1qAWURYtXA.jpeg)

Part of the challenge for React, though, is remembering which children have changed. This is especially true if your application involves manipulating the order of the child components.

For example, imagine if we allowed users to drag and reorder the position of the ten Buttons in ButtonList. How would React be able to keep the state of each button when the list indices are constantly changing?

> This is especially dangerous if we give users the ability to delete Button components they don’t need. React might delete the wrong information by mistake!

To fix this problem, React likes you to provide a unique identifier for each child component you create. This unique id is called a `key` in React.

Since ours is a simple list of Buttons, adding the keys is easy enough:

class ButtonList extends React.Component {  
  renderButton(i) {  
    return (  
      <Button   
        key={i} // The Button now has a key!  
        onClick={(i) => this.handleClick(i)}   
      />  
    );  
  }  
  renderButtonList() {  
    let buttonList = \[\];  
    for (let i=0; i<10; i++) {  
      buttonList.push(this.renderButton(i));  
    }  
    return buttonList;  
  }  
  handleClick(i) {  
    // do something to the button where key===i  
  }  
  render() {  
    return <div>{this.renderButtonList()}</div>;  
  }  
}

#### Ah-ha Moment

In the example above, you can see that we added a key to the calls to `renderButton`. But we also added the key, `i`, to all the calls to `onClick` and `handleClick`. That way, React knows exactly which `Button` component to update when there's a click event.

Keys are crazy important, and they can get a lot more complicated, but they’re what allows React to keep track of the unique state of tons of different components on a page.

### Constructors, super(), Local State: Open Pandora’s Box

Speaking of keeping track of state, React allows you to store some local information about the state of a component. This is useful if you want to keep history or information about a Component’s progress through a workflow.

For instance, in our `ButtonList` example, if we wanted to keep a register of how many times buttons have been clicked and in what order, we'd need to keep some information on the state of the list inside the `ButtonList` component.

Do do so, we use a constructor to initialize the component state:

class ButtonList extends React.Component {  
  constructor(props) {  
    super(props);  
    this.state = {  
      clickCount: 0,  
    };  
  }

  ... // The rest of the component that we've already seen.

}

All React components have a state built in, so we need to call `super(props)` to be able to access the parent class’s (React.Component) constructor to be able to update the state.

Now that we have built our constructor, we can modify and use the state:

...

  handleClick(i) {  
    const clickCount = this.state.clickCount;  
      
    ... // Do something

    this.setState({  
      clickCount: clickCount + 1,  
    });  
  }

  ...

We now have a counter that increases every time there’s a click on a `Button`.

This is a simple example to illustrate state. I don’t recommend you use it as a counter in a real application. Instead, you’d probably want to create a `this.state.history` variable that stores exactly which button was clicked at which point as an array of the current state at different points in time.

Then, if you need a click count, you can access it with `this.state.history.length`, and that click count will be correct even if you undo past changes.

#### Ah-ha Moment

State and history open up a whole new world of potential applications. Now you can build some complex stuff with React, simply by storing state information.

> Want to add/remove items from a shopping cart? React state can handle that.

> Undoing moves in a browser Chess game? Component state has you covered.

> Rendering components differently based on user toggles? State can help you there as well.

Understanding and getting good at `this.state` (along with `this.props`) is the key to getting good at React.

### Use Function Components for the Simple Stuff

Since we give all the power to the parent components in React, child components can end up being pretty dumb.

Consider the final version of our basic `Button` component:

class Button extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <button onClick={props.onClick}>  
        {props.buttonValue}  
      </button>  
    );  
  }  
}

All that component does is render a button. Since it’s so simple, we don’t actually have to create a whole class for it in React.

Instead, just make it a function:

function Button(props) {  
  return (  
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>  
      {props.buttonValue}  
    </button>  
  );  
}

We’ve removed two lines of code, but we’ve also avoided extending `React.Component`. `Button` just got a lot simpler to maintain and use.

### Your Problem with JSX Is You Don’t Understand JSX

I’ve been avoiding it thus far, but if you’re new to React you’ll notice that React mixes in something that looks like HTML directly with JavaScript notation.

This confuses many newcomers to React because they think it **_IS_** HTML.

> It’s not. The markup in React is actually called JSX, and it has some key differences from HTML that impact how you use it.

The most important thing to understand about JSX is that Babel (a JavaScript compiler that React uses) is changing JSX over to JavaScript behind the scenes.

When you write in JSX:

const element = (  
  <h1 className="greeting">  
    Hello, world!  
  </h1>  
);

Babel converts it to:

const element = React.createElement(  
  'h1',  
  {className: 'greeting'},  
  'Hello, world!'  
);

`React.createElement` is how the ReactDOM knows what to render.

You could write your entire React components using `React.createElement` directly instead of JSX. But JSX is just nicer to look at and since all web devs know HTML, it's more comprehensible what will happen with that element.

Babel’s conversion of JSX has some important implications, though.

First, `React.createElement()` only creates one element. That element can have child elements nested within it, but Babel doesn't know what to do with more than one element.

For example, this won’t work in JSX:

return (  
  <h1>Hello World</h1>  
  <p>Nice to meet you</p>  
);

However, if we nest those elements inside another, it will work:

return (  
  <div>  
    <h1>Hello World</h1>  
    <p>Nice to meet you</p>  
  </div>  
);

If you find yourself needing to return multiple elements like this often, you might consider using `React.Fragment` instead:

return (  
  <React.Fragment>  
    <h1>Hello World</h1>  
    <p>Nice to meet you</p>  
  </React.Fragment>  
);

`React.Fragment` allows you to add multiple elements without adding a bunch of unnecessary `div`s to the DOM.

JSX also allows you to embed JavaScript directly into your syntax to be evaluated after compilation:

function getGreeting(user) {  
  if (user) {  
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;  
  }  
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;  
}

JSX is safe against injection attacks. You can create JSX variables from user inputs and then use those variables throughout your app without any problems. React escapes all values embedded in JSX and it converts everything to strings before rendering.

One more challenge that trips up newcomers is that JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML. As such, it uses camelCase for all naming schemes.

Notice I’ve used `onClick` in our `ButtonList` examples instead of the standard HTML `onclick`.

Since JSX will become JavaScript, JavaScript keywords are off limits. Therefore, if you need to specify a CSS class in JSX, you’ll need to call it `className`.

### Loops & Conditions in the render() Method

> JSX and React impose some limitations on conditions and loops you can use inside the `render()` method of a component.

This can be frustrating to newcomers. But often the solution is simply to create a separate method that runs the loop or the condition and then call that method from within `render()`.

One pattern you often see in React is the use of `.map()` to turn an array into a set of elements.

For instance, it’s common to keep a `this.state.history` with information about what has happened in the past for a given component. It's often formatted as an array of objects where `this.state.history[0]` is the state of the component at the beginning of the session and `this.state.history[this.state.history.length]` is the most recent change.

Let’s imagine you wanted to list out recent changes as a list.

To do so, we’d use `.map()`:

const history = this.state.history;

const changes = history.map((changeNum, changeDesc) => {  
  return <li key={changeNum}>{changeDesc}</li>;  
}

You can make `.map()` as complicated as you need it to be, creating variables inside the arrow function you call in order to render the elements, CSS classes, and content as needed.

### const vs let & Why React Prefers Immutability

I applaud you if you’ve made it this far into this guide. You’re committed to learning React fundamentals!

> Once you have this core understanding down, everything else you’ll learn about React is the fun part!

JavaScript introduced new keywords for declaring variables in ES6. A lot has been written about the keywords `let` and `const` and why you would use them instead of `var`. However, it's important to understand how these new declarations affect React.

> React officially prefers the use of `const` when declaring your variables.

Of course, this means that you can’t change the `const` later on in your program. Instead, you'll need to make sure your declarations of constant variables are well scoped inside functions and other scope blocks so that values can be saved and returned.

That’s not to say you won’t use `let` or `var` in React! There are still plenty of applications for mutable variables.

The reason React prefers immutability when possible is because so many other things are changing in React. It makes it easier to predict what your application will do when the underlying variables can’t change.

In addition, immutability allows us to save past values of certain variables. If we use a `const` inside a function and then add the value of that `const` to `this.state.history` (and vice versa), then we have the basis of state history, allowing us to undo/redo and revert to certain points in time.

Consider the example we used above:

const history = this.state.history;

const changes = history.map((changeNum, changeDesc) => {  
  return <li key={changeNum}>{changeDesc}</li>;  
}

Because we grab values from the state history, we know those values won’t need to change. When they do change, we’ll save those changes as new entries in `this.state.history`.

### Welcome to React!

Whew, that was a doozie of a guide! I hope it was useful.

Now that you have an understanding of the broader context of how React fits together, developing your React web apps and understanding complex projects in React gets easier.
