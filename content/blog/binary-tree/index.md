I've been playing around with binary trees today. Partly to get back into a little coding & partly to shake off the cobwebs on data structures for potential interviews.

In the spirit of making my process public, I'll share the [binary tree code](https://gist.github.com/bennett39/9cd9d44fdbb0a495a60f721336cffd4c) I whipped up today.

I'm also easing back into my Anki study deck for algorithms. I use flashcards to do spaced repetition review of different problems. It helps dramatically with rapid recall when in an interview setting.

Reply to this email if it'd be helpful for me to publish my Anki deck. Happy to do so if someone would find it useful.
